# NEWS-APP
A news app which provide live headlines from 70 different sources (newspapers, websites) such as BBC News,CNN, Financial Times, The Hindu, The Times of India etc

I have created this  web application using News API and Laravel.

News API is a simple and easy-to-use API that returns JSON metadata for the headlines currently published on a range of news sources and blogs.

Also i have used Guzzle , which is a is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial to integrate with web services.
